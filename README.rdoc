This is where my website will be!  It's pretty excessive to build a homepage
using ruby on rails, but then if I had my way everything would be done in
Common Lisp and there would be no libraries allowed. I need to be able to hold
rails in my head like I can hold Python. This library structure is way more
complicated than a list comprehension, though. It's funny how intelligence
and knowledge and skills are formed, and where aptitudes lie. I can program
a world, but I can't use a programmed world. Until now. I think learning
to use foreign libraries might be analogous to growing up.  What do you think?
